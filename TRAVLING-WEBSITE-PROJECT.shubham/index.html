                    <p>The legend of the Surkanda Mata temple holds great significance. According to the Puranas, during a celestial celebration of the marriage of Lord Shiva and Parvati Devi, all the gods and goddesses were present. However, an asura named Shankhchud arrogantly insisted on being present in his disguised form. Shankhchud had promised at that time to reveal the emperors. In order to stop him, Parvati Mata attempted to fall from the sky in her heavy-bodied form. However, when her body fell from the sky, it was so heavy that the Earth said it could not hold it. Then Mata Parvati squeezed Shankhchud with both her hands and pressed him down on the Earth. 
                     As a result, her name became Surkanda, and she appeared as Surkanda. Since then, this place testifies to the glory of the mother and preserves this temple in tradition.</p>
